The project is designed to provide a seamless and efficient platform for patients to manage their healthcare appointments.
Users can easily book appointments with doctors based on available time slots, cancel or reschedule appointments as needed, and reach out directly to the medical staff for any queries or concerns. 
The system ensures that both patients and healthcare providers can manage their schedules effectively, reducing wait times and improving overall patient satisfaction.
